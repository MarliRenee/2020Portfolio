                <p>Marli Renee here. I'm a designer, developer & artist based in San Diego. I care about excellent, accessible education. My art, designs and multi-module courses have been used by government agencies, 
                schools, and Fortune 500 companies. I started as a children's educational illlustrator, but curiosity eventually led me to UI/UX and full-stack web development. </p>
